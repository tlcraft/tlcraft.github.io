    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>My name is Travis Craft and I&apos;m a full stack software engineer. My experience has revolved around .NET and AWS using agile practices (such as Scrum, SAFe, and Kanban).</p>
    <p>I like using SOLID principles and functional concepts to write clean code, and I learn a little more about software engineering each day as I work toward Microsoft and AWS certifications.</p>
    <p>
        I run a software engineering Meetup group in my community. We hold presentations, lightning talks and have an ongoing book club. We also have monthly lunch meetings.
        Check out our next meeting here: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Kalispell-Software-Crafters/">Kalispell Software Crafters</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Apart from software I practice Aikido and study Japanese using Duolingo and have a recurring language exchange with a friend in Tokyo.</p>
